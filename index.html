<h3>Passage: </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">
            Sarah had just returned home after a long day at school. Her backpack was slung over one shoulder, and she kicked off her shoes at the door, letting out a deep sigh. The house was quiet, and she could hear the soft ticking of the clock in the living room. As she walked into the kitchen, she noticed that the table was set for dinner, but her parents weren’t there. Sarah opened the refrigerator and found her favourite leftovers from last night’s meal, neatly packed in a container. She smiled and sat down to eat.

        <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">
            Jake stood on the sidelines, clutching his basketball. His team had just lost the game by two points, and he stared at the scoreboard with a mixture of frustration and sadness. His jersey was damp with sweat, and his coach patted him on the shoulder, saying, "You gave it your all, Jake. We'll get them next time." Jake nodded silently, then grabbed his water bottle and sat down, watching the other team celebrate their victory.

        <h3>Inference Question: </h3>

            Emma’s alarm clock blared loudly, jolting her awake. She groaned, pulling the blanket over her head as sunlight streamed through the curtains. The calendar on her desk was marked with a big red circle around today’s date, and her bag was packed and ready by the door. "First day of summer camp," Emma muttered to herself, her voice a mix of nervousness and excitement. She sat up, took a deep breath, and started to get ready.
